 Hi, everybody. Figured I'd be the guinea pig for

2
00:52:20.000 --> 01:38:20.000
 this new video capability on Clickify.

3
01:45:20.000 --> 02:31:20.000
 Thank you so much for joining today's session.

4
02:39:20.000 --> 03:23:20.000
 I wanted to go ahead and follow up with you on

5
03:23:20.000 --> 03:52:40.000
 how to do a video on Clickify.

6
04:00:00.000 --> 05:01:20.000
 We did see that issue today where Clickify wasn't going to

7
05:01:20.000 --> 05:53:40.000
 allow Microsoft Edge to access the video.

8
06:01:20.000 --> 06:34:00.000
 It's now solved, so I'm going to post

9
06:34:00.000 --> 07:19:00.000
 that workaround in the chat for you as well.

10
07:29:40.000 --> 08:19:20.000
 I'm really excited to show you all the tool today,

11
08:34:40.000 --> 09:13:40.000
 and thinking we can do a little challenge here,

12
09:15:20.000 --> 09:43:00.000
 so I'm going to pass the torch on.

13
09:46:20.000 --> 10:48:00.000
 I accepted this challenge from Rodrigo to do this video,

14
10:50:00.000 --> 11:33:00.000
 and I am now going to challenge him to do a video.

15
11:36:40.000 --> 12:22:00.000
 It can be on anything you want for 60 seconds or less,

16
12:31:20.000 --> 13:26:40.000
 and then would challenge Rodrigo to challenge somebody else,

17
13:27:00.000 --> 13:51:20.000
 so we can keep this little chain going.

18
13:55:20.000 --> 14:09:40.000
 Thanks so much. Bye.
